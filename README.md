### Hi, I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a focus on Game Development. Currently I am focusing on programming in Unity whilst also learning various other tools and languages used in game development.

Feel free to check out my repositories where I share some of my projects and experiments.
